# This game requires two players, Player X and Player O. Player X always starts off each game.
# The game validates player moves and keeps track of whose turn it is. The game displays a textbased 
# graphic view of the Tic-Tac-Toe game board, which it updates after each player’s turn.
# The game ends when one player lines up three board squares in a row (horizontally, vertically,
# or diagonally), or when all ggame board squares have been selected without either player being
# able to pull out a win.
